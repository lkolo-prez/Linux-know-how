# Linux

This repository serves as my knowledge base for Linux, a popular open-source operating system widely used in various environments. It contains useful information, tips, and examples related to Linux administration, command-line usage, and system configuration.

## About Linux

Linux is a Unix-like operating system kernel that forms the foundation of numerous Linux distributions. It was initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and has since become one of the most prevalent operating systems, powering servers, desktops, mobile devices, and embedded systems.

Linux offers a robust and flexible environment for users and administrators, with a rich set of features and tools. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) where users can interact with the system, execute commands, manage files and directories, install software, and configure various services.

Some key features and benefits of Linux include:

- **Open-source nature**: Linux is distributed under various open-source licenses, allowing users to view, modify, and distribute the source code freely.
- **Stability and security**: Linux is known for its stability, reliability, and security. It benefits from constant community-driven development and bug fixes.
- **Flexibility and customization**: Linux provides extensive customization options, enabling users to tailor the system to their specific needs and preferences.
- **Vast software ecosystem**: Linux offers a wide range of software applications, libraries, and utilities, both through official package repositories and third-party sources.
- **Command-line power**: Linux's command-line interface provides powerful tools and utilities that allow for efficient system administration, automation, and scripting.

## Examples

Here are a few examples showcasing common Linux commands and tasks:

1. **File manipulation**:

   ```bash
   # Create a new directory
   mkdir my_directory

   # Navigate to the directory
   cd my_directory

   # Create a new empty file
   touch myfile.txt

   # List files and directories
   ls

   # Copy a file
   cp myfile.txt newfile.txt

   # Remove a file
   rm myfile.txt
   ```

2. **Package management** (using APT package manager on Debian-based distributions):

   ```bash
   # Update package lists
   sudo apt update

   # Install a package
   sudo apt install package_name

   # Search for a package
   apt search search_term

   # Remove a package
   sudo apt remove package_name
   ```

3. **Process management**:

   ```bash
   # List running processes
   ps aux

   # Kill a process by PID
   kill PID

   # Monitor system resources
   top

   # Find running processes by name
   pgrep process_name
   ```
